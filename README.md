## Purpose
* To develop a Generative Adversarial Network to classify fake traffic in network traffic feeds and augment training data with realist synthetic data to balance the dataset and provide robust data.
* To develop and discover the most effective and efficient GAN variant
* Understand how to process cybersecurity data to train a DNN model

# Models

* CGAN
* CWGANGP
* CTGAN
* WGAN

## Steps to run

* Clone Repo

* Download the CICIOT dataset extract and put it into the repo directory under a folder as _archive_ or _parent_dir/archive_

* run the .py files in parent dir
