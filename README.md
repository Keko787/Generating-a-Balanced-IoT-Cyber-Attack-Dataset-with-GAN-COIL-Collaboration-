## Purpose
* To develop a Generative Adversarial Network to classify fake traffic in network traffic feeds and augment training data with realist synthetic data to balance the dataset and provide robust data.
* To develop and discover the most effective and efficient GAN variant
* Understand how to process cybersecurity data to train a DNN model
